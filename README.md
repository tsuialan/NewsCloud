[NewsCloud](https://newswordcloud.wl.r.appspot.com/) is a python flask based progressive web app that attempts to visualize recent headlines of contemporary popular newspaper websites into a wordcloud. It is an attempt to streamline all the popular newspaper sites into one very simple interactive user interface that is both easy to comprehend and covenient for users of any backgrounds.
